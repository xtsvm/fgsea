\title{Runs preranked gene set enrichment analysis.}
\usage{
fgsea(pathways, stats, nperm, minSize = 1, maxSize = Inf, nproc = 1,
  gseaParam = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{pathways}{List of gene sets to check.}

\item{stats}{Named vector of gene-level stats. Names should be the same as in 'pathways'}

\item{nperm}{Number of permutations to do. Minimial possible nominal p-value is about 1/nperm}

\item{minSize}{Minimal size of a gene set to test. All pathways below the threshold are excluded.}

\item{maxSize}{Maximal size of a gene set to test. All pathways above the threshold are excluded.}

\item{nproc}{Number of parallel processes to use.}

\item{gseaParam}{GSEA parameter value.}
}
\value{
A table with GSEA results. Each row corresponds to a tested pathway.
The columns are the following:
\itemize{
 \item pathway -- name of the pathway as in `names(pathway)`;
 \item pval -- an enrichment p-value;
 \item padj -- a BH-adjusted p-value;
 \item ES -- enrichment score, same as in Broad GSEA implementation;
 \item NES -- enrichment score normalized to mean enrichment of random samples of the same size;
 \item nMoreExtreme` -- a number of times a random gene set had a more
     extreme enrichment score value;
 \item size -- size of the pathway after removing genes not present in `names(stats)`.
}
}
\description{
The function takes about \emph{O(nk^\{3/2\})} time,
where \emph{n} is number of permutations and \emph{k} is a maximal
size of the pathways. That means that setting `maxSize` parameter with a value of ~500
is strongly recommended.

\examples{
data(examplePathways)
data(exampleRanks)
fgseaRes <- fgsea(examplePathways, exampleRanks, nperm=10000, maxSize=500)
# Testing only one pathway is implemented in a more efficient manner
fgseaRes1 <- fgsea(examplePathways[1], exampleRanks, nperm=10000)
